Code 301, Day 2

I was introduced to Jquery. I have previously never utilized Jquery in a larger project. This was good intro.

Additionally, we covered Regexes. Regexes are something of  a weakness for me -- so this was nice.

Finally, I reinforced the previous day's subject material by introducing responsive web design to my portfolio site.
