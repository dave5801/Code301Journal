Introduction to Node. I learned about servers using Express - this was new information. I am not an expert regarding
basic HTTP requests. 

The algorithm was starting to get a little more challenging. Bring it on!

Also new material regarding SQL tables should prove interesting. I would like to see how that works with Node (MongoDB?)
