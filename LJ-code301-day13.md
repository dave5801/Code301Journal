I learned about Heroku. Its pretty straightforward.

I do have a point of criticism for the class. This regarding CodeWars - specifically algorithm challenges. 
Nick demonstrated a solution to the class utilizing javascript methods taught in class. This is understandable
as it is way to reinforce what we've already learned. However, I think the real purpose of the code challenges
is to logically problem solve (to make it past a technical interview). Therefore, rather teaching functions
specific to a language - I think the answer is to analyze the fundamental logic of the problem itself. How do we
approach such a problem, what does the problem accomplish - I say this because I had a technical interview once where
I was told I was not allowed to use any libraries or predefined functions. Honestly, teaching a problem in terms of 
callbacks etc - did not teach me really anything.
