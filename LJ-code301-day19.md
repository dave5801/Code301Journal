Today began with some frustration.

Much of original project contributions were refactored without informing me. As a result, I have fallen behind the project. 
After my teammates made these decisions -- I was uncertain how to make any new contributions. I suspect this is a more common occurence
than it feels right now. I don't feel that it was fair that some teammates stayed late -- when I was under the impression we were done for
the day. I realize there are no scrum masters, product owners, or program managers to keep developers/engineers in line -- but I do
feel there could be a more concerted effort by the instructional team to manage students -- there I are actually parts of the project I wished
I could have done more. I addressed the matter with a teammate - there were no feelings of hostility and the decisions were not actually 
intentional. 

There was additional outreach to ensure no one felt excluded. So no hard feelings.

For what it's worth -- I have learned a great deal from this course and will immediately start building my own projects. At least,
my technical contributions were not intentionally disregarded by malicious teammates - that has happened to me at the proffesional level. 

I'm probably just letting my individual anxiety get the better of me. As long as I am learning, that's all that matters. 

(I apologize for sounding depressing)
