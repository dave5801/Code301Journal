Today was a substantial improvement.

I was able to follow most of what class was about. I will say that I definetley struggle watching someone else code. The class, 
fortunately, was a little better this time.

I was able to accomplish a many algorithms in CodeWars I noticed that they do not like loops that are written as follows:

for(var i in xyz){...}

Instead preferring the conventional: for(var i =0; i < xyz.length; i++){...}

Not sure why that is.
