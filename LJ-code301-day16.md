Day 16

Learned probably more in one day on the Project than throughout the rest of the course.

I built out the index.html along with functionality for MVC on our Single Page App. I learned the 
true purpose of a View, Model, and Controller. The Index.html is just the skeleton that shows everything 
where to go. The View is about appending information to the DOM, the Controller just tells the View how 
and when to show itself --> the real trick was getting it to work with the SQL querries. SQL .querry will
immediately look for requests of certain type (get, delete, etc). This how a querry in server.js is bound
to a method in a controller class. I have previously seen this in Java/Spring -- which uses XML binding and
the @symbol to bind methods across classes. Page routing is also pretty interesting.

Good experience overall.
