I am going to voice my displeasure at the last class. The purpose of the class was to build something from scratch as a demonstration
to the class.

I found this experience to be highly frustrating. I had virtually no understanding of the problem. I never spoke up because I honestly
did not know what questions to ask. The exercise included absolutely no description of the problem or any use cases. I had no idea 
what problems were being solved. The instructor coded at a rate that I was unable to follow. My personal preference is to analyze the 
problem before writing code. This is best practices.

However, this was not the true problem of this class.

The real problem was that the same 2-3 people dominated the class discussion. These individuals demonstrated absolutely no regard 
for their classmates. I find it amusing that we began the day with a lecture on showing respect to the opinions of coworkers. Negligence 
is a form of disrespect. No one talked to me. No one engaged me. I had not idea what was going on. I wanted to scream at those people.

Classmates who demonstrate obnoxious and selfish personality traits should not be rewarded or given precedence.

I learned absolutely nothing.

This is not acceptable.
